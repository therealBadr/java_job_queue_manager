Database Layer Components:
├── schema.sql           (Database structure)
├── db/Database.java     (Connection management)
└── db/JobRepository.java (JDBC operations)

Your Goal:
- Store Job objects in a relational database
- Query/update them using JDBC
- Ensure thread-safe, concurrent access
- Implement crash recovery
